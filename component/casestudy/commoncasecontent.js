                        <p>At the core of Book X-Change is the MEAN stack â€“ a JavaScript software stack for building dynamic web sites and web
                        applications, consisting of MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js; the MEAN stack provided a hyper-scalable,
                        efficient, and JavaScript only solution to build Book X-Change from the ground up.</p>
                        <p>With the use of a service-oriented-architecture. We were able to reduce the workload on the client side by pushing all
                        of our application logic to the Node API, not only was this time-efficient, this also allowed for seamless mobile
                        development with NativeScript, a JavaScript mobile framework that retains the speed and functionality of any native
                        application.</p>
                        <p>Book X-Change is secured with a JWT solution. JSON Web Tokens is an industry standard RFC-7519 method for representing
                        claims securely between two parties; protecting the API as well as our users.</p>
                        <p>Book X-Change lives on the cloud. We use AWS EC2 to host the API and AWS S3 for the Angular application and static files
                        such as book images, and profile pictures.</p>
